    <br>
    Over the past 30 years, many research organizations established
    large-scale immersive visualization laboratories. Some have been
    very successful, but others are no longer around. With the recent
    availability of COTS virtual reality devices, the need for larger
    immersive visualization laboratories comes into question.&nbsp; Some
    immersive visualization laboratories have moved away from large
    scale facilities due to the cost of maintaining these more elaborate
    systems. But can immersive visualization requirements be satisfied
    solely using COTS VR devices used by researchers in their own
    office?<br>
    <br>
    The goal of this workshop is to gather practitioners from immersive
    visualization laboratories to share their success stories,
    information about their hardware setups and the software they used
    and/or developed.&nbsp; Discussion can also include
    "not-so-successful" stories with lessons learned and workshop
    participants will also come together to discuss the future of
    large-scale immersive visualization labs. We also hope to bring
    visualization practitioners together to advance the way our field
    works with immersive visualization hardware and software frameworks
    for a sustainable immersive visualization laboratory.<br>
    <br>
    The program will consist of a balanced mix of keynote talks, paper
    presentations, and panel discussions around the current state of
    immersive visualization labs, and the path forward. Topics of
    interest to the “Immersive Visualization Laboratory” workshop may
    include, but are not limited to:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Success stories in research institutions and industry</li>
      <li>Not-so-successful stories in research institutions and
        industry</li>
      <li>Strategies for sustainability</li>
      <li>Scientific and visualization workflows for large-scale labs <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Immersive visualization laboratory panel questions<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Do we still need immersive visualization laboratories?</li>
      <li>What is missing from existing immersive visualization
        laboratories?</li>
      <li>How much can we rely on custom code vs. shared tools?</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    Complete papers must be submitted electronically through PCS:
    https://new.precisionconference.com/~vr and select the track for
    IEEE VR 2023 Workshop: Immersive Visualization Laboratories -
    Past,...<br>
    <br>
    All paper submissions must be formatted using the IEEE VGTC
    conference format described at
    https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/. Due to short
    submission deadline, only short papers are solicited. Accepted
    papers will also be invited to make a full paper submission to a
    special issue on Immersive Visualization Laboratories with PRESENCE.<br>
